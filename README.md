# Denotebook

Random helper methods for use with Deno + Jupyter notebooks.

Goal is easy-to-use helper methods that render well in Github.

Users beware: I intend to make plenty of semver-major changes over time on a whim.
This is not a community driven project - it's a personal library that I'm making
publicly available to make my own usage easy to share. Feel free to fork it.
